**Hello, and welcome to my blog!**

*Gradient boosting at work*

Here I will post articles about everything I learned during my studies and update/add them whenever I learn something new. 
In the near future I will post articles on: LASSO, delta method, law of large numbers, CLT and I want to replicate [Common statistical tests are linear models](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/) which means I will cover the most common statistical tests, more distributions and the most versatile model ever, the linear model! My long term goal is to cover all basic statistical concepts plus some advanced ones and all common ML methods.

I hope these articles may help others in understanding statistics.
